# Family Jamz

Ever wonder who's the 'old soul' of the group? Well if music taste is 
any indication, here you can find out by analyzing your shared Spotify playlists.

Get a cheeky report of some selection habits of your friends tracks, like 
'oldest average track release date' or 'number of explicit tracks'. Compare and
reflect on what your friends contributions say about them as a person (just kidding, it's not that deep, but 
can definitely lead to some fun conversations!)
